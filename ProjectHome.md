Yeti3d-pvr is a port of the Yeti3D engine by Derek J. Evans to the Sega Dreamcast videogame console.  It is built with the free KallistiOS (KOS) development library and uses the onboard 3D hardware for rendering.  Yeti3d-pvr also has support for md2 models in place of sprites.  Source code for versions of the demo using SDL and OpenGL for rendering has also been included in the Subversion repository in for those interested, with Makefiles for Linux (and a Dreamcast makefile for the non-OpenGL SDL demo, although this has not been tested on the Dreamcast recently).

There is some [Example Code](http://code.google.com/p/yeti3d-pvr/wiki/PVR_Example_Code) with an explanation for those who need help getting started using Yeti3D on the Dreamcast.  There is also an example using an md2 model for the enemy entity in [the SVN repo](http://code.google.com/p/yeti3d-pvr/source/browse/trunk#trunk/platform/pvr/md2_example).
