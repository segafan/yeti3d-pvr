This is Marcus Comstedt's scramble.c but I changed some text in main() that
won't affect functionality.  For anyone who may be new to Dreamcast development,
homebrew programs must be scrambled in order to be used on a self-booting disc,
and this is the program that everyone uses to scramble their binaries.

To compile (under Linux), typing "gcc -o scramble scramble.c"
should give you a working scramble executable.  Windows (Cygwin) users will
probably want to type "gcc -o scramble.exe scramble.c," although you probably
already have scramble if you're using the DCDev ISO.
